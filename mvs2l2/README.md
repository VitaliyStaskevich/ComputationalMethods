# Lab 2

This repository contains an implementation of the second lab work, namely `Cubic spline interpolation`

# Overview
Overview
This program performs cubic spline interpolation using equidistant nodes.
The results of the interpolation and the associated errors are written to output files.
The primary objective is to assess the interpolation errors when using cubic splines.

# Usage

The program interpolates the function `F` using the equidistant nodes generated by the `fillPoints()` function.
The spline then is constructed using the `constructSOLAE()` function to create the system of the linear algebraic equations.
This system is then solved using the `solveTridiagonal()` function, which uses the *Thomas algorithm*.

To use this program to interpolate your function:
1. Change the `a` and `b` variables to the bounds of the interplation domain
2. Change the `F` function to the function you want to interpolate, and `derF` to the first derivative of this function
3. Run the programm using
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
   ```
   ```
   main.cpp
   ```
   
4. Plot the graphs using the python script in the `graph` folder
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
