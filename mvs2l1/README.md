# Lab 1

This repository contains an implementation of the first lab work, namely `Algebraic polynomial interpolation`

# Overview
Overview
This program performs polynomial interpolation  using both equidistant and Chebyshev nodes.
The results of the interpolation and the associated errors are written to output files.
The primary objective is to compare the interpolation accuracy between equidistant and Chebyshev nodes.

# Usage

The program interpolates the functions `F1` and `F2` using the nodes generated by `fillValuesChebyshev()` and `fillValuesEquidistant` functions.
To use this program to interpolate your function:
1. Change the `a` and `b` variables to the bounds of the interplation domain
2. Change the `F1` and/or `F2` functions
3. Run the programm using
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
   ```
   ```
   main.cpp
   ```
   
4. Plot the graphs using the python script in the `graph` folder
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
